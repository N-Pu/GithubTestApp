Simple and yet easy app for searching people accounts on github. 

It is THE "Git Seacrh". 

The program itself is just a simple scroll layout with profile icons and names of users. 
When you tap on them you'll get to another layout with more info for the current user. 

How to use this app in 3 steps:

STEP 1. Open this icon on your smartphone. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40484678/190857895-1a2a1b7b-1834-484b-809e-c661ca74fe48.png)
